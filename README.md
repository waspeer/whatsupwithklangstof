  <h1>Klangstof news page</h1>
  <p>Super simple new page for Klangstof</p>
</div>

This is a news page for the band [Klangstof](https://klangstof.com). It's made in Typescript and Gatsby.

It's a bit overengineered on the tests because I wanted to learn how to set up Cypress and Jest/react-testing-library in a Gatsby project.

## Try it out

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn develop
```
